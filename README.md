# Brandon Cazares
# CECS427 Sec 1 
# Assignment 2 Social and Large Networks 
# Due Date: 2/28/2025

Objective
# In this assignment, we're going to modify our graph.py file from assignment 1 because our aim is to practice class-learned concepts to generate graphical representations in Python. 
# These representations mean they critically identify nodes and edges. 
# These tasks are to master our Python skills including computer cluster coefficients and neighborhood overlaps with a given graph. 
# Therefore, these graphs will be partioned to store thier information from one graph to another because primary groups will be stored in another graph. 

Requirement
# This assignment's requirement is to create a Python program that runs in a terminal because we need to understand that the program accepts optional parameters. The syntax to run this program has this command 

python ./graph_analysis.py graph_file.gml --components n --plot [C|N|P] --verify_homophily --verify_balanced_graph --output out_graph_file.gml

Description of Parameters
# this is the command to execute the Python script graph_analysis.py located in the current directory because we need to understand that this reads the graph_file.gml. 
# Here, we need to know that graph_file.gml is the file that will be used for the analysis and the format here is Graph Modeling Language (.gml), which describes the graph's structure with those attributes. 
# Also, the program should read the attributes of both nodes and edges in a file.
